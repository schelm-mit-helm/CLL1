## 🪞 **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Drawing the art:** Choosing a colour scheme was easy and drawing in pixel-art-style a new experience that went well.
- **Making the Music for the Game:** It was my first time making game music, I enjoyed it.

### Challenges:
- **Limited Time:** Due to sickness I had less time and struggled to start the game.
- **Implementing Anything:** I don't know much about js and due to that my game is not the best.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Ask for Help:** I struggled with this immensly, still do, but these weeks showed me that it is important to.
- **Aim for reasonable goals:** Look at your time and skills and make the best of it.
